          Your bathroom serves a string of busy functions on a daily basis. See
          how you can make all of them work, and still have room for comfort and
          relaxation.

          A cleaning hub with built-in ventilation
        </span>
        <span className="h5">
          Use a rod and a shower curtain to create a complement to your cleaning
          cupboard. Unsightly equipment is stored out of sight yet accessibly
          close-while the air flow helps dry any dampness.

        </div>
        <span className="h5 fw-bold">Storage with a calming effect</span>
        <span className="h5">
          Having a lot to store doesn’t mean it all has to go in a cupboard.
          Many bathroom items are better kept out in the open – either to be
          close at hand or are nice to look at. Add a plant or two to set a calm
          mood for the entire room (and they’ll thrive in the humid air).
        </span>
        <span className="h5 fw-bold">Kit your clutter for easy access</span>
        <span className="h5">
          Even if you have a cabinet ready to swallow the clutter, it’s worth
          resisting a little. Let containers hold kits for different activities
          – home spa, make-up, personal hygiene – to bring out or put back at a
          moment’s notice.

          <span className="h5 fw-bold">An ecosystem of towels</span>
          <span className="h5">
            Racks or hooks that allow air to circulate around each towel prolong
            their freshness. They dry quick and the need for frequent washing is
            minimized.
          </span>
          <span className="h5 fw-bold">Make your mop disappear</span>
          <span className="h5">
            Having your cleaning tools organized makes them easier to both use
            and return to. When they’re not needed, close the curtain and feel
            the peace of mind it brings.
